# Clawd ZK Integration

This directory is the ZK subsystem for `clawdbot-go`. It is designed to be
read by three surfaces:

- The Go runtime catalog command: `clawdbot catalog zk`
- The local skill library through `zk-primitives/agent/SKILL.md`
- The local agent catalog through Clawd agents that call `@clawd/zk-agent`
- The Cloudflare installer metadata endpoint:
  `/.well-known/clawdbot-zk.json`

## Local Catalog Roots

The runtime defaults to these local roots:

| Surface | Default | Override |
|---|---|---|
| Skills | `~/skills/skills` | `CLAWDBOT_SKILLS_DIR` |
| Agents | `~/agents/agents/src` | `CLAWDBOT_AGENTS_DIR` |
| ZK primitives | `./zk-primitives` | `CLAWDBOT_ZK_PRIMITIVES_DIR` |

Use:

```bash
clawdbot catalog
clawdbot catalog skills zk
clawdbot catalog agents zk
clawdbot catalog zk
clawdbot catalog --json
```

The catalog command is read-only. It does not install packages, execute skills,
sign transactions, or send Solana instructions.

## Edge Discovery

The Cloudflare Worker in `cloudflare/install-worker.js` publishes a read-only
view of this directory for install pages, CLIs, and dashboards:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.onchainai.fund/.well-known/clawdbot-zk.json
curl -fsSL https://zk.x402.wtf/clawdbot/.well-known/clawdbot-zk.json
```

The endpoint mirrors the local manifest shape: package names, operation names,
docs, accepted environment variables, and trust gates. Treat it as discovery
data only. A caller that wants to build or submit an instruction must still load
the local package and pass the runtime trust gate.

## Runtime Shape

```text
user / agent intent
  -> @clawd/zk-agent routeIntent()
  -> ClawdZkAgent method
  -> @clawd/zk-client instruction builder
  -> clawd-zk Anchor program
  -> Light Protocol compressed state
```

The agent package owns intent routing and operator-friendly commands. The client
package owns byte packing, public inputs, nullifiers, and instruction building.
The on-chain program owns Groth16 verification and compressed-state updates.

## Trust Gates

| Action | Trust level | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Inspect config | Observer | Local only |
| Verify proof shape | Observer | Structural sanity check, no pairing |
| Compute nullifier | Observer | Local hash derivation |
| Build instruction | Dry-Run | Produces a transaction instruction |
| Sign and send | Delegated | Requires explicit signer/operator policy |

Live transaction submission should remain outside automatic catalog discovery.
The catalog can show that ZK capability exists; it should not silently arm it.

## Package Boundaries

| Path | Owner | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `agent/` | Agent wrapper | Deterministic routing, CLI, config inspection |
| `client/` | SDK | Types, proof packing, nullifier derivation, instruction builders |
| `configs/` | Network metadata | Light tree addresses and runtime examples |
| `docs/` | Architecture | Design, trust model, integration guidance |
| `programs/` | On-chain program | Anchor instruction handlers and Light CPI boundary |
| `tests/` | Cross-package tests | Off-chain SDK tests and on-chain test notes |

## Production Checklist

1. Replace placeholder program IDs and Light signer values with deployed IDs.
2. Pin trusted verifying keys per circuit instead of accepting arbitrary VKs.
3. Replace JSON instruction encoding shims with canonical Anchor/Borsh encoding.
4. Run `npm test` for the TypeScript packages.
5. Run `cargo test-sbf -p clawd-zk` with a Light-compatible validator.
6. Publish the final `MANIFEST.json` alongside package versions and deployment IDs.
7. Run `node --test cloudflare/install-worker.test.mjs`.
8. Verify the deployed Worker metadata endpoint before announcing install URLs.
